This application was created as a prototype that a group and I worked on. The initial process involved us creating a project report. Topics that were considered in the development proceess where the scope of the work, the scope of the product, stakeholders, requirements, constraints, legal requirements, design consideration, how to address projecg issues and updates, and more. A link to the report is found below.

My contribution in the code involved creating the main page the user sees when opening up the application. I coordinated with other team members to help transition to different scenes and show back-end analysis in the front-end.
